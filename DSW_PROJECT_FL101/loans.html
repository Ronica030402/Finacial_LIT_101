    <h2>What Is A Loan?</h2>
    <p>Loans are defined as the transfer of property, money, or other tangible assets in return for the eventual repayment of the loan amount plus interest and other finance costs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Do Loans Work?</h2>
    <p>You can use loans to help you reach important life goals like going to college or purchasing a home that you otherwise couldn't afford. There are loans available for a variety of purposes, including ones that can be used to settle previous debt.
        However, it's critical to understand the kind of loan that would best meet your needs before taking out any loans.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What The Most Common Types Of Loans?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Personal Loans-</b> Personal loans can typically be used for anything, unlike vehicle and mortgage loans, which have specific uses in mind. 
            For example, some people utilize them for home renovation projects, weddings, or unexpected bills. Most personal loans are unsecured, which means they don't call for any kind of security. 
            They could have a few months to several years of repayment time and fixed or variable interest rates.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Car Loans-</b>An auto loan allows you to borrow the balance of the car's purchase price, less any down payment. When the borrower stops paying payments, the vehicle is used as collateral and may be repossessed.
            Although lengthier loan durations are increasingly prevalent as auto costs rise, auto loan terms typically range from 36 to 72 months.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Student Loan-</b>can support the cost of higher education. Both the federal government and private lenders have them available. Because they include deferment, forbearance, forgiveness, and income-based repayment choices, federal student loans are more favorable.  Every borrower receiving the same sort of loan will be subject to the same loan terms, which include fees, repayment schedules, and interest rates.
            Contrarily, private lenders for student loans typically demand a credit check and set their own loan conditions, interest rates, and fees. 
            These loans lack advantages like loan forgiveness or income-based repayment schedules, in contrast to federal student loans.</li>
