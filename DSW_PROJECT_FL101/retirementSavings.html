    <p>What does retirement actually mean?<br>
    Retirement is the stage of life at which one decides to leave the workforce behind forever.<br> The majority of developed countries, including the United States, have a national pension or benefits<br>
    system  in place to augment retirees' wages, and the usual retirement age in these nations is 65.
   </p>
   <p>Here are  four reasons on why  you should save for retirement </p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>You Shouldn't Rely on Social Security</li>
            <p>  Nobody's retirement income should not be based entirely on Social Security.<br> The Social Security Administration estimates that after retirement, its payouts replace<br>
                 around 40% of the average wage earner's income. According to the majority of financial<br> consultants, retirees will require roughly 70% of their pre-retirement earnings to live comfortably.<br>
                You'll still need to come up with around 60% of the money necessary to live well <br>
                after retiring, even with Social Security. Saving for your own retirement gives<br>you the chance to design the retirement you want, in addition to not wanting to<br>
                rely on public policy as your retirement plan. Making lifestyle adjustments to save more money now <br>could be necessary. But if you do it now, you'll have a better chance of surviving.</p>
            <li>You May Not Want to Burden Your Dependents</li>
            <p>You probably wouldn't mind spending as much time as you can with your kids if you had any.<br>
                You presumably also want that to be up to you, though. The majority of people don't want <br>
                to spend their retirement years having to live with the kids because they cannot afford to<br>
                live independently. In addition to not wanting to forfeit your way of life, think about what<br>
                it would mean for your kids if you have to rely on them. Due to having to help you financially,<br>
                they can miss out on their own financial possibilities and experience increased pressure on their own family.
                </p>
            <li>You May Miss Out on the Effects of Compounding</li>
                <p> Let's say you invest $50,000 and it earns 8% annually. This generates income<br>
                     of $4,000 per year. If your tax rate is 22%, you would pay the government $880,<br>
                    leaving $53,120 available for investment. You would not only pay less in taxes, <br>
                    but the compounding impact of tax-deferred growth would increase the value of your investments:<br>
                    If you put the money into a tax-deferred account, it would be about $630,000.<br>
                    Approximately $580,000 if you decided to save the money after taxes  If the <br>
                    earnings period is longer and the amount saved is higher, the numbers become much more appealing.</p>
