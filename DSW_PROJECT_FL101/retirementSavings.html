    <p>What does retirement actually mean?<br>
    Retirement is the stage of life at which one decides to leave the workforce behind forever.<br> The majority of developed countries, including the United States, have a national pension or benefits<br>
    system  in place to augment retirees' wages, and the usual retirement age in these nations is 65.
   </p>
   <p>Here are  four reasons on why  you should save for retirement </p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>You Shouldn't Rely on Social Security</li>
            <p>  Nobody's retirement income should not be based entirely on Social Security.<br> The Social Security Administration estimates that after retirement, its payouts replace<br>
                 around 40% of the average wage earner's income. According to the majority of financial<br> consultants, retirees will require roughly 70% of their pre-retirement earnings to live comfortably.<br>
                You'll still need to come up with around 60% of the money necessary to live well <br>
                after retiring, even with Social Security. Saving for your own retirement gives<br>you the chance to design the retirement you want, in addition to not wanting to<br>
                rely on public policy as your retirement plan. Making lifestyle adjustments to save more money now <br>could be necessary. But if you do it now, you'll have a better chance of surviving.</p>
            <li>You May Not Want to Burden Your Dependents</li>
            <p>You probably wouldn't mind spending as much time as you can with your kids if you had any.<br>
                You presumably also want that to be up to you, though. The majority of people don't want <br>
                to spend their retirement years having to live with the kids because they cannot afford to<br>
                live independently. In addition to not wanting to forfeit your way of life, think about what<br>
                it would mean for your kids if you have to rely on them. Due to having to help you financially,<br>
                they can miss out on their own financial possibilities and experience increased pressure on their own family.
                </p>
            <li>You May Miss Out on the Effects of Compounding</li>
                <p> Let's say you invest $50,000 and it earns 8% annually. This generates income<br>
                     of $4,000 per year. If your tax rate is 22%, you would pay the government $880,<br>
                    leaving $53,120 available for investment. You would not only pay less in taxes, <br>
                    but the compounding impact of tax-deferred growth would increase the value of your investments:<br>
                    If you put the money into a tax-deferred account, it would be about $630,000.<br>
                    Approximately $580,000 if you decided to save the money after taxes  If the <br>
                    earnings period is longer and the amount saved is higher, the numbers become much more appealing.</p>

             <div>
                <p>Saving for retirement is important for your peace of mind, but how do you find the right solution for you?</p>
                <p>Investment alternatives for retirement planning.There are various investment solutions<br>
                    that can be used to save money for retirement. The fundamental product structure is the<br>
                   same, even though there may be variations in some product elements between other<br>
                   financial services providers (such as the underlying investments on sale and minimum contributions).</p>
                   <p><b>Retirement funds</b></p>
                   <p>The most tax-effective method of investing for retirement is through retirement funds.<br>
               First off, you can deduct your payments to the fund from your taxes up to a specified<br>
                amount*. In other words, if you make regular monthly contributions to a retirement fund,<br>
                 you pay less income tax. Second, no income, dividend, or capital gains taxes apply to <br>
                 the earnings on your retirement fund investments. However, there are restrictions on how<br>
                 you can access your money before you retire, and in some cases, you have no say over how it is invested.
                   </p>
                   <p>Pension fund</p>
                   <p>If your business offers retirement benefits, they will typically supply this,<br>
                     and it will probably be required of you to join the fund. The monthly contribution<br>
                    will be split between the firm and you. The trustees choose the investment options<br>
                    or asset managers that are offered to pension fund participants, so you have a predefined <br>
                    menu to choose from. To guarantee that assets are invested in a way that balances risk<br>
                    and rewards for members, more conservative investment limits are in place. You can choose<br>
                     to accept up to a set percentage of the total amount as a tax-free cash lump payment when you retire.
                </p>

                <p>Provident fund</p>
                <p> This is comparable to a pension fund in that your company also provides it.<br>
                     It is typically required to join the fund, and both you and your employer must <br>
                     contribute. But with the provident fund, you can either receive 100% of your <br>
                     contributions plus growth for the time previous to 1 March 2021 as a lump sum at<br>
                      retirement or use some of it to buy an annuity. You can choose to take one-third <br>
                      of the total contributions plus growth from 1 March 2021 onwards as a cash lump <br>
                      sum when you retire (if you were under 55 at the time), but you must use the<br>
                     remaining two-thirds to invest in an annuity that will provide you with a regular income during retirement.</p>
