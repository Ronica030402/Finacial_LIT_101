   <h2>How To Build Credit.</h2>
    <h3>What is credit?</h3>
    <p>Credit is the ability to borrow money or obtain goods and services before payment is made,<br>
     with the promise to repay the amount borrowed or the value of the goods or services provided at a later time,<br>
     often with interest or fees. In other words, credit is a type of financial arrangement where one party provides funds or<br>
     goods to another party with the expectation of receiving payment later. <br>
     <br>
    Credit can come in many forms, such as credit cards, loans, mortgages, and lines of credit.<br>
    It can be used for a variety of purposes, including buying a home or car, paying for education, <br>
    starting a business, or making everyday purchases. <br>
    <br>
   Credit is an important part of the financial system, as it allows individuals and businesses to access funds <br>
   and make purchases they might not be able to afford otherwise. However, it's important to use credit responsibly and <br>
   to understand the terms and conditions of any credit arrangement to avoid overextending yourself and damaging your credit history.</p>
   <h2>Building Credit Steps:</h2>
   
    <p>Building credit is an important part of your financial journey as it can help you secure loans,<br>
    credit cards, and even lower interest rates. Here are some steps you can take to build your credit:<br></p>
     <p>Step 1:<br>
    Open a credit account: Start by opening a credit account, such as a credit card or a loan.<br>
    If you have no credit history, you may need to apply for a secured credit card or a credit-builder loan.<br>
    Step 2:<br>
    Make payments on time: One of the most important factors in building credit is making timely payments.<br>
    Pay at least the minimum amount due each month, and ideally, pay your balance in full<br>
    Step 3:<br>
    Keep your credit utilization low: Your credit utilization is the amount of credit you’re using <br>
    compared to your credit limit. Try to keep your utilization below 30% to build good credit.<br>
    Step 4:<br>
    Monitor your credit report: Regularly check your credit report for errors or fraudulent activity. <br>
    You can get a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus.<br>
    Step 5:<br>
    Consider becoming an authorized user: If you don’t qualify for a credit card on your own,<br> 
    you can ask to become an authorized user on someone else’s <br>account.<br>
    This can help you build credit, but keep in mind that you are not responsible for making payments.<br>
    Step 6:<br>
    Be patient: Building credit takes time, so be patient and continue to make responsible credit decisions.<br>
